AJAX allows data to be sent and received from a server asynchronouslyâ€”without reloading the entire web page. This improves user experience by enabling parts of a web page to update dynamically in response to user actions.
ðŸ“¦ Key Components of AJAX:
JavaScript â€“ Triggers the request and processes the response.
XMLHttpRequest â€“ The built-in JavaScript object used to make asynchronous HTTP requests.
DOM â€“ JavaScript updates the Document Object Model based on the response.
Server-side Script â€“ A PHP, Node.js, Python, etc. script that handles the request and sends a response.
Data Format â€“ Often JSON (modern) or XML (older), used to exchange data.
